solution that would not only load basic tests in this environment, but
would be able to test the full stack of the phone, from launching an
app to sending an SMS.<br/>
<br/>
To get this flexibility, we decided to start the Marionette project.
The goal of the project was to integrate the WebDriver protocol (used
in Selenium) directly onto the phone, which would enable us to
remotely connect to and control running devices or emulated device
instances. By having a remote test driver connect to multiple
instances, we are not only able to hook up our existing tests, but
this also enables us to write new and dynamic tests like
device-to-device calling. It also uses the same protocol as Selenium,
so testers can easily add a Selenium test, and it would automatically
work in the phone environment."""

tuned release process as well as a unique engineering culture that makes
